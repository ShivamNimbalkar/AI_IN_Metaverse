<h1>Title: AI in Metaverse Using ChatGPT</h1>
Project Description:
Project Overview
This project is a Unity-based interactive application that utilizes the Oculus Quest 2 as its hardware device. The application has been built using the Unity platform and incorporates various packages from the Unity Store and Registry, such as the "Oculus Integration Package" and "Text Mesh Pro XR Development Kit."

Features
The application consists of three scenes:

Splash Screen
Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a visually appealing splash screen. The splash screen provides three options:

Start: This option leads the user to the main "Start" scene, where the core project functionalities are implemented.
About: When selected, this option provides information about the application, its purpose, and any relevant details.
Quit: Selecting this option will exit the application.
Start Scene
In the "Start" scene, the main project functionality is presented. The scene is designed using Unity's Canvas system, allowing for an intuitive user interface.

Chat Bot Implementation

One of the key features of the project is the implementation of a chat bot using the OpenAI API. The chat bot interacts with the user, answering questions and providing responses based on the user's input. Here's how it works:

User Input: Users can input questions or text into a designated input section on the Canvas.
API Request: When the user submits a question, the application sends a request to the OpenAI API, passing the user's input for processing.
Chat GPT Processing: The user's question is processed by the ChatGPT language model on the OpenAI servers.
Response Display: The response generated by ChatGPT is received by the application and then displayed on the Canvas, allowing the user to view the chat bot's answer.
The chat bot can handle multiple questions in a session, and users can ask as many questions as they desire.

**Note: You need to have an API key for you project.**

Miscellaneous
The project integrates various Unity packages to enhance the user experience. Notably, the "Oculus Integration Package" enables seamless integration with the Oculus Quest 2 hardware, providing an immersive VR experience. Additionally, the "Text Mesh Pro XR Development Kit" is used to optimize and enhance text rendering for VR.
